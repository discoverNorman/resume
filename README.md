## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I lead AI-SDLC transformations for Fortune 100 enterprises. For the past four years at Microsoft, I have defined how the world's largest organizations adopt generative AI across their entire software development lifecycle. Prior to Microsoft, I led engineering transformations at Ford Motor Company, Eli Lilly, Ally Financial, Quicken Loans, and other Fortune 500 accounts across auto manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, financial services, and defense.

I created **Z2A (Zero to Agents)**, the platform Microsoft uses to help enterprise customers adopt GitHub Copilot with speed, minimal friction, and measurable results. Hundreds of thousands of customer engineers have been onboarded through Z2A. Hundreds of Microsoft employees now deliver it at scale. The platform aligned 300+ stakeholders across Product, GTM, Engineering, and Sales around a single AI-SDLC transformation framework and became the company standard.

My career follows a single trajectory: helping engineering organizations fundamentally change how they build software. First through agile and DevOps transformation. Then through cloud-native modernization. Now through AI-native development. The underlying work has remained consistent throughout—organizational change management centered on people, process, and engineering discipline.

I continue to write code daily. This is not incidental. It is the foundation of my credibility with F100 technical executives. I do not present the future of their SDLC from a slide deck. I demonstrate it live, from production-quality code.
