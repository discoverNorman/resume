> *"If you had $50 million, all of your IP, and all of your customers—how would you build software? Measure today. Measure tomorrow. Build the p99 team to achieve flow."*
>
> That's the question I ask every F100 CTO I sit across from. Not to sell them something. To find out if they're ready to change. The answer is never "the way we do it today." The answer is an AI-native SDLC, rebuilt from first principles—measured against where you are now, measured against where you're going, and built around the best team you can field. I help them see it, design it, and build it.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Engineering leader who still writes code every day. I work with executives across healthcare, finance, auto manufacturing, and tech to navigate the shift to AI-native software development. After two decades building and leading engineering teams, I focus on the human side of AI transformation: how leaders adapt, how teams evolve, and how organizations avoid the common pitfalls of AI adoption.

The use case is not "where do we apply AI." **The use case is your entire SDLC.** Writing code, reviewing code, debugging, testing, refactoring, documenting, migrating, requirements, design, deployment—all of it. If you're still asking about use cases, you're trying to understand a paradigm shift through the lens of the old paradigm. You're asking "what can I automate?" when the question is "how do we work differently?"

I built **Z2A (Zero to Agents)**—the platform Microsoft uses to help enterprise customers adopt GitHub Copilot fast, frictionlessly, and with great results. Hundreds of thousands of customer engineers onboarded. Hundreds of Microsoft employees now able to deliver it. It aligned 300+ people across Product, GTM, Engineering, and Sales around a single AI-SDLC transformation framework, and it became the standard because it works. That wasn't an engineering project. It was organizational change management at scale, built by someone who writes the code, presents to the CTO, and delivers the outcome.

My career is a single thread: **help engineering organizations change how they build software.** First through agile and DevOps transformations at Ford Motor, Eli Lilly, Ally Financial, and Quicken Loans. Then through cloud-native modernization. Now through AI-native development. The technology changes. The work doesn't—it's always about people, process, and the courage to rebuild.

You cannot understand agentic development by reading about it. You cannot delegate this understanding. You have to build. I build every day. That's not a footnote—it's the reason executives trust me. I don't describe the future of their SDLC from a slide deck. I demo it live, from a codebase I wrote that morning.

## HOW I GOT HERE

### Microsoft — Principal Solutions Engineer → Developer Advocate

When a Fortune 100 CTO asks *"How do we actually adopt AI in how we build software?"*—I'm the person Microsoft sends into the room. Every executive conversation I have starts the same way. Tooling budgets. Adoption dashboards. Training roadmaps. All of it oriented around the technology. None of it oriented around the people. Somewhere between twenty minutes and twenty months in, someone asks the real question: *How do we know our people can actually do this?* That's where I operate.

**What I built:**
- **Z2A (Zero to Agents)** — The platform Microsoft uses to help customers adopt GitHub Copilot fast, frictionlessly, and with great results. Hundreds of thousands of customer engineers onboarded through Z2A. Hundreds of Microsoft employees now able to deliver it at scale. Aligned 300+ people across Product, GTM, Engineering, and Sales around a single AI-SDLC transformation framework. Not a tool rollout—a change management system. It became the company standard because it changed behavior, not just toolchains.
- **The enterprise AI-SDLC transformation playbook.** The change management framework that moves organizations from experimentation to production-scale adoption—across process, team structure, toolchain, measurement, and culture. Designed around the reality that AI doesn't fix subpar engineering. It amplifies whatever is already there. Strong engineer plus agent equals dramatically more output. Multiply by zero and you get zero.
- **The technical credibility engagement model.** Demo-first, architecture-led, outcomes-driven. No slide decks. Working code. This became the standard approach for enterprise Copilot adoption because executives don't trust people who can't build the thing they're recommending.

**What it produced:**
- F100 CTOs and VPs of Engineering treat me as a technical peer. Architecture reviews, live code demos, strategic roadmap sessions. I ask them: *"If you had $50M, your IP, and your customers—how would you build software?"* Then we build that answer together.
- Enterprise GitHub Copilot adoption from early-access through production rollout at the largest organizations in the world. Built the frameworks, ran the pilots, measured the outcomes, expanded the footprint.
- Skeptical engineering leaders converted into transformation partners at Microsoft Executive Briefing Centers—through technical credibility and radical honesty about what AI can and can't do today.
- A bench of engineers and technical sellers across Microsoft who can now have AI-SDLC transformation conversations at the executive level. Organizational capability that compounds.

### Agent Driven Development — Founder & Writer

Published body of thought leadership on AI-native software development, read by CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and engineering directors navigating the shift. Not marketing. Not vendor content. The honest, uncomfortable conversations about what this transformation actually requires.

**What I built:**
- **[agentdrivendevelopment.com](https://agentdrivendevelopment.com)** — A platform for CxOs, engineering leaders, and developers. Published works including:
  - *"What Got You Here Won't Keep You Here: A Letter to Technology Executives"* — Why the skills that made you a successful executive won't make you someone boards want in 2028.
  - *"The People Conversation"* — A workforce qualification framework for the AI era. Written exams, whiteboard design, agent-assisted builds. What you'd expect from a fresh CS graduate—and why it should be the standard for your entire technical organization.
  - *"The Use Case Is Building Software and the Best Practice Is Today"* — Stop asking about AI use cases. The use case is your entire SDLC.
  - *"The 2028 Problem You're Creating in 2025"* — Why waiting for clarity is the riskiest strategy, and why three years of transformation experience will be the most valuable thing on your resume.
  - *"Congratulations: You Just Reinvented Peter Gibbons from Office Space"* — How enterprise measurement systems train top performers to do just enough. That's not their failure. It's yours.
  - *"Dear Jim in Detroit — Don't Punish Your Top AI Dev"* — Why punishing your fastest AI adopters creates a lose-lose situation.
  - *"Stop Asking for 'Advanced' AI Training"* — Advanced AI training is a status marker, not a learning objective.
  - *"If Your Vendor Doesn't Ask These Three Questions Before the Demo, Politely Ask for a Field CTO Who Will"*

**What it produced:**
- An independent voice in the AI-SDLC transformation space. Content segmented for CxOs, VPs, Directors, Managers, and Developers—each getting the conversation appropriate to their level.
- A growing Discord community of AI-SDLC practitioners sharing what actually works.
- A body of work that executives reference in their own transformation conversations. The ideas spread because they're honest.

### Canton Coders — Founder & President

The industry spent twenty years throwing bodies at problems. Everyone knew it didn't work. Fred Brooks explained why in 1975. I started Canton Coders because I believe in people—in qualifying them, developing them, and putting them in roles where they can ship.

**What I built:**
- A 1,000+ member global developer community from zero. Meetups, livestreams, hackathons, workshops, mock interview nights, career fairs. 100+ free events. Never charged anyone for anything. Always 100% free. Always 100% about the individual developer.
- Regular livestreams on AI-assisted development, engineering lifecycle evolution, and the shift to agent-driven workflows. A public body of work.
- A workforce qualification culture: mock technical interviews, coding workshops, career development—building the muscle that the industry stopped requiring.
- **"60 Years of Dev — Hopper to AI"** — Flagship 2026 reboot tracing the full arc of how software gets built, from punch cards to agents.

**What it produced:**
- 90+ developers placed in better roles through career fairs, mock interviews, mentorship, and direct advocacy. Zero cost. Always. These are people who spent years building expertise in a system that rewarded certain behaviors. The game changed. I helped them change with it.

### Cprime — Practice Lead & Principal Consultant

Ran a 30-person consulting practice delivering SDLC transformation. Full P&L ownership across a multimillion-dollar digital transformation portfolio. Sold transformation, not tools—then delivered the organizational change to make it stick.

**What I built:**
- Executive relationships with client leadership teams. Transformation roadmaps designed around organizational reality, not methodology theater. Technical due diligence: codebase evaluations, SDLC maturity assessments, change readiness analysis.
- A practice culture built on honesty. There's no SAFe for what's coming. No Scrum certification. No transformation theater you can purchase from a consultancy that makes this make sense. I built a practice that told customers the truth, then helped them do the work.

**What it produced:**
- $2M in ARR in under 9 months. Repeat business built on trust and measurable engineering improvement.
- Got recruited by Microsoft.

### LeadingAgile — Principal Technical Consultant

Embedded with F100 executive teams to design and deliver large-scale SDLC transformations. This is where I learned that changing how an organization builds software is the hardest, most valuable thing you can do for them. It's always, always about people.

**What I built:**
- Transformation strategies with CTOs and CIOs at **Ford Motor Company** and **Eli Lilly**. The question was always the same: *How do we fundamentally change how we build software?* I helped them answer it—then led the engineering teams that made it real.
- Monolith decomposition, CI/CD adoption, testing strategy, and delivery transformation programs for organizations with thousands of engineers. Less handoffs. Less bureaucracy. More shipping. Fewer stops between the person who understands the problem and the person who builds the solution.

**What it produced:**
- Multi-year, multi-million-dollar transformation engagements across auto manufacturing, pharma, medical devices, and naval defense.
- Relationships that renewed year over year. Ford and Lilly came back because the change stuck and the outcomes were measurable. That's the only metric that matters.

### Ally Financial — Principal Kubernetes & DevOps Consultant

**What I built:**
- A production Kubernetes-on-OpenShift CI/CD pipeline—SonarQube, Jenkins, GitHub, Clarity. Trained and mentored SDET teams on modern testing and DevOps practices.

**What it produced:**
- Changed how the team shipped software. Fewer queues. Less information loss. Every management layer is translation. Every approval gate is a queue. Every handoff is information loss. We removed the ones that didn't need to exist.

### Quicken Loans (via GalaxE.Solutions) — Principal Consultant

**What I built:**
- Recruited, trained, and led 30 developers. Built a delivery team and an engineering culture from zero.

**What it produced:**
- A functioning engineering organization shipping software. People who could design systems on a whiteboard, reason about tradeoffs, and ship working product.

---

### Battelle Memorial Institute — Principal Consultant

Life-critical software for chemical weapons disposal. When the SDLC has zero margin for error, you learn what process discipline actually means. You learn that every process exists because someone got hurt without it.

**What I built:**
- Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) for the safe disposal of Cold War-era chemical weapons—rockets, artillery shells, and chemical agents. MSSQL, R, C#, DevExpress. Compliant with laboratory safety standards.

**What it produced:**
- Software that keeps people alive during the most dangerous disposal operations on earth. No room for shortcuts. No second chances. The kind of engineering that makes you take every SDLC decision seriously for the rest of your career.

### Greenlight Guru — Founding Engineer

First engineer. Built v1.0 alongside the CTO. Defined the SDLC for a company that didn't have one yet. An FDA-regulated medical device compliance startup where shipping broken software isn't an option—it's a federal violation.

**What I built:**
- The company's first product—FDA Medical Device Compliance for Part II/Part III medical devices. Java microservices, Ember front-end.

**What it produced:**
- The engineering foundation for what became a market-leading quality management platform. Shipped to production in a regulated industry from day one. Proof that a strong engineer who can externalize their thinking and build from first principles can create something that outlasts them.

---

### Hearst Health — Technical Lead

Pharmaceutical software development for the MedKnowledge Framework. Introduced the company's first agile SDLC and CI/CD pipeline. Built engineering culture in an organization that had neither.

**What I built:**
- Next-generation pharmaceutical screening algorithms—partnered directly with doctors, pharmacists, and engineers. API infrastructure in Java and C#. Engineering standards for the team. Mentored four developers.

**What it produced:**
- The company's first agile CI/CD implementation. A team that could ship with confidence. Engineering culture where there had been none. The beginning of a career spent doing exactly this—building the SDLC, building the team, building the culture. Then doing it again somewhere harder.
